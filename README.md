# Engo-651-Lab-4

In this lab, youâ€™ll learn about using Turf.js, and how to use it to add spatial analysis to your web mapping applications. You will be making a map of Calgary Schools and Calgary Health Clinics and Hospitals. When a user clicks on a school, the map will show which clinic or hospital is nearest.
